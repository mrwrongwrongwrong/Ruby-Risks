# Ruby-Risks
Final Project for Heuristic Problem solving. Enjoy the game by "python main.py". :)

Well, "python main.py" in terminal works on my Linux system.

Since my mac OS system has multiple python environment installed, in order to start the game, execute

## python3 main.py

in termain.

In addition, I did not use pycharm this time, just run it in the terminal.

By executing:
## pip3 install python3.7-tk

I solved my problem.
